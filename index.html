                J.R.R. Tolkien is an internationally renowned fantasy writer and
                artist. He is best known for authoring 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord
                of the Rings' trilogy.

              <h3>Who Was J.R.R. Tolkien?</h3>
              <p>
                J.R.R. Tolkien was an English fantasy author and academic. Tolkien
                settled in England as a child, going on to study at Exeter
                College. While teaching at Oxford University, he published the
                popular fantasy novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
                trilogy. The works have had a devoted international fan base and
                been adapted into award-winning blockbuster films.
              </p>
              <h3>Early Life and Family</h3>
              <p>
                John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa,
                on January 3, 1892, to Arthur Tolkien and Mabel Suffield Tolkien.
                After Arthur died from complications of rheumatic fever, Mabel
                settled with four-year-old Tolkien and his younger brother,
                Hilary, in the country hamlet of Sarehole, in Birmingham, England.
                Mabel died in 1904, and the Tolkien brothers were sent to live
                with a relative and in boarding homes, with a Catholic priest
                assuming guardianship in Birmingham. Tolkien went on to get his
                first-class degree at Exeter College, specializing in Anglo-Saxon
                and Germanic languages and classic literature.

              <h3>Books: 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings'</h3>
              <p>
                The award-winning fantasy novel The Hobbit — about the small,
                furry-footed Bilbo Baggins and his adventures — was published in
                1937, and was regarded as a children’s book, though Tolkien would
                state the book wasn’t originally intended for children. He also
                created more than 100 drawings to support the narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, while working on scholarly publications, Tolkien
                developed the work that would come to be regarded as his
                masterpiece — The Lord of the Rings series, partially inspired by
                ancient European myths, with its own sets of maps, lore and
                languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tolkien released part one of the series, The Fellowship of the
                Ring in 1954; The Two Towers and The Return of the King followed
                in 1955, finishing up the trilogy. The books gave readers a rich
                literary trove populated by elves, goblins, talking trees and all
                manner of fantastic creatures, including characters like the
                wizard Gandalf and the dwarf Gimli.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Rings had its share of critics, many reviewers and waves
                upon waves of general readers took to Tolkien’s world, causing the
                books to become global bestsellers, with fans forming Tolkien
                clubs and learning his fictional languages.

              <h3>Legacy and New Adaptations</h3>
              <p>
                The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series are grouped among the
                most popular books in the world, having sold tens of millions of
                copies. The Rings trilogy was also adapted by director Peter
                Jackson into a highly popular, award-winning trio of films
                starring Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett and Viggo
                Mortensen, among others. Jackson also directed a three-part Hobbit
                movie adaptation starring Martin Freeman, which was released from
                2012 to 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tolkien's son Christopher has edited several works that weren't
                completed at the time of his father's death, including The
                Silmarillion and The Children of Húrin, which were published
                posthumously. The Art of the Hobbit was published in 2012,
                celebrating the novel's 75th anniversary by presenting Tolkien's
                original illustrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Underscoring the enduring popularity of Tolkien's famed fantasy
                world, in November 2017, online retail and entertainment behemoth
                Amazon announced that it had acquired the TV rights for the book
                series. In its statement, the company revealed plans to "explore
                new storylines preceding Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring,"
                with the potential for a spinoff series, thereby exciting fans
                with the promise of a prequel to the familiar deeds of Bilbo
                Baggins, Gandalf and the rest.

                  In his high-fantasy novels, British author J.R.R. Tolkien
                  combined his academic training in languages and his love of
                  storytelling to create Middle-earth, a fictional continent
                  populated by wizards, elves, orcs, dragons, hobbits, talking
                  trees and other mythical creatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But Middle-earth didn’t just live in Tolkien’s head: The Lord of
                  the Rings author was also a skilled artist who sketched, painted
                  and mapped the worlds that he was imagining as he wrote about
                  them. Many of the original illustrations in the Hobbit were
                  created by Tolkien himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Audiences can now view a selection of Tolkien’s rarely seen Lord
                  of the Rings artworks for free via the Tolkien Estate’s newly
                  updated website, reports Sarah Cascone for Artnet. The portal,
                  which debuted last month, also allows viewers to explore
                  documents, images and audio clips related to Tolkien’s personal
                  life and his lesser-known pursuits as a mapmaker, calligrapher
                  and artist.

                  According to an emailed statement, the site features 12
                  previously unpublished items, including Tolkien’s paintings of
                  flowers and exotic birds, a draft manuscript of The Homecoming
                  of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm’s Son (1953), and photographs of the
                  author and his family.

                  Born John Ronald Reuel Tolkien in 1892, the writer was orphaned
                  at a young age. He fought in the trenches during World War I
                  after graduating from the University of Oxford. He later
                  returned to Oxford as a professor, earning fame as a linguist
                  and publishing a translation of the Old English epic poem
                  Beowulf. Elements of Beowulf, Tolkien’s closely held Roman
                  Catholic faith and his friendship with other British writers
                  such as C.S. Lewis have all been cited as major influences on
                  the Lord of the Rings.

                  Many of Tolkien’s books started as bedtime stories for his four
                  children: John, Michael, Christopher and Priscilla. A devoted
                  father, Tolkien drew elegant pictures for his children when they
                  were young and wrote frequent letters to them as adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Christopher created many of the maps for the Lord of the Rings
                  based on his father’s detailed plans, notes Harriet Sherwood for
                  the Guardian. He served as Tolkien’s literary executor until his
                  death in 2020. (Tolkien, for his part, died in 1973 at age 81.)
                  The author’s youngest child and only daughter, Priscilla, died
                  just last month, on February 28, at the age of 92, according to
                  a statement from the Tolkien Society, a charity and literary
                  society that operates independently of the Tolkien Estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tolkien began working on the manuscript that became the Hobbit
                  in the early 1930s. That book was so successful upon its 1937
                  publication that Tolkien’s publishers encouraged him to write
                  more stories about hobbits, whom he describes as short, gentle
                  people who live in holes underground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These subsequent tales became the Lord of the Rings, which was
                  published in three volumes between July 1954 and October 1955
                  and quickly became one of the most famous English-language
                  fantasy series in modern history. More than 150 million copies
                  of the trilogy, which has been translated into dozens of
                  languages, have been sold to date.
